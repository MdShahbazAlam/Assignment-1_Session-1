Problem Statement

1. Say True or False for the below statements:
* Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?
Answer- False
* Base R packages installed automatically?
Answer- True

2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
Answer- Recycling of vectors means when we perform an operation (like addition, multiplication, subtraction, etc.) 
between two or more different vectors having some elements and the length of element stored in it differ from each other, 
then the elements of the smaller vector repeat itself to match the length of the larger vector and then perform the operation.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
Answer-
Example:
X <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
Y <- c(1, 2, 3)
X * Y
Output- c(1, 4, 9, 4)
As the length of Y vector was smaller, to match with the X vector it repeated itself and match the length with X 
vector as Y <- c(1, 2, 3, 1).
